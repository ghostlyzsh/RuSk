# RuSK
This is the official repository of the RuSk programming language,
a language based off of [Skript](https://github.com/skriptlang/skript).
RuSk aims to improve the syntax of Skript, by making it more similar to other programming languages.
It also aims to have clearer errors than those of Skript's.
